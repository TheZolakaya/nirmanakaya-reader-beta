# API SYSTEM PROMPT: Correction Lookup Tables

Add this to the system prompt sent to the API. This ensures the AI uses lookup tables rather than trying to derive corrections mathematically.

## CORRECTION LOOKUP TABLES

CRITICAL: Always use these lookup tables for corrections. NEVER calculate corrections mathematically. The transient (what is operating) gets corrected, not the position (where it's operating).

### ARCHETYPE CORRECTIONS (Majors 0-21)

When the transient is an Archetype (Major), use these tables:

TOO MUCH (Status 2) → Use Diagonal Partner:
0 Potential (Fool) → 19 Actualization (Sun)
1 Will (Magician) → 20 Awareness (Judgement)
2 Wisdom (High Priestess) → 17 Inspiration (Star)
3 Nurturing (Empress) → 18 Imagination (Moon)
4 Order (Emperor) → 15 Abstraction (Devil)
5 Culture (Hierophant) → 16 Breakthrough (Tower)
6 Compassion (Lovers) → 13 Change (Death)

## CORRECTION RULES

1. ALWAYS look up the correction from these tables - NEVER calculate mathematically
2. The TRANSIENT gets corrected, not the position
3. Position is WHERE the energy is showing up
4. Transient is WHAT energy is operating there
5. Status is HOW that energy is expressing (Balanced/Too Much/Too Little/Unacknowledged)
6. When describing corrections, always name both Nirmanakaya name and (Traditional name)
